Given a directed graph (V,E) of Vectors {Start, Aux1, Aux2, Aux3, Dest} and Edges {(Start, Aux1),(Aux1, Aux2),(Aux2, Aux3),(Aux3, Dest),(Aux3, Aux1)} design an algorithm to successfully move a stack of N discs from the Start peg to the Dest peg. Each disc has a diameter that is larger than the discs above it on the stack. You can only move one disc at a time, you can only move a smaller disc onto a stack with larger discs. and you can only move discs by using edges in the directed graph.
